# This is our Github page for our CSC431 Software Engineering Project that describes our idea for a COR workout mobile application.
# COR is a smarter, more modern way to stay healthy and train with your community.
# It is a mobile app that incorporates your personal health statistic data and gives users customized health and training recommendations.
# COR encourages collaboration within your community by offering events and messaging platforms so like-minded people can meet up and enjoy wellness activities together.
